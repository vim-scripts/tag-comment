This plugin defines commands that properly comment and uncomment
tags in XML/HTML files.  It relies on the "vat" command
to select the tag under the cursor.  This does not understand
HTML tags that are not terminated (ex. <br> and <input>) or
XML tags that are terminated in the shorthand way (ex. <x/> and <x />).

It is recommended that these commands be mapped to keys like the following:
nnoremap <leader>xc :XmlComment<cr>
nnoremap <leader>xu :XmlUncomment<cr>

When a tag containing comments is commented out,
the comment delimiters are changed from <!-- --> to <!__ __>
so they can be restored if the tag is uncommented later.
