This plugin provides commands that "properly" comment and uncomment XML and HTML tags. All the plugins I have seen for this would take the following:

<foo>
  <bar>baz</bar>
</foo>

and comment it like this:

<!--<foo>-->
  <!--<bar>baz</bar>-->
<!--</foo>-->

This is ugly and excessive!
I believe the proper way to do this is:

<!--foo>
  <bar>baz</bar>
</foo-->

The provided XmlComment command does this and the provided XmlUncomment command does the opposite.
These even support nested comments. See the README file for more detail.
